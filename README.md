# Sliding-Cards

This is a simple project I found at https://www.frontendmentor.io/ to which I added some effects. 

Project is fully responsive. 

Only the middle card (blue one) has a "Learn more" button. Try to click the right or left one to see the effects and get the button. 

Also you can switch prices from Annually to Monthly. 

Link to the project can be found in the "About" section.
